### Clustering Methods

    K-Means algorithm can be broken down into following steps:
        1. Randomly initialize cluster centers
        2. Assign each point to the closest center
        3. Compute new center of each cluster
        4. Stop if cluster assignments did not change
        5. Go to step 2

    Args:
        features - Array of N features vectors. Each row represents a feature
            vector.
        k - Number of clusters to form.
        num_iters - Maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run.

def hierarchical_clustering(features, k):
    """ Run the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm.

    The algorithm is conceptually simple:

    Assign each point to its own cluster
    While the number of clusters is greater than k:
        Compute the distance between all pairs of clusters
        Merge the pair of clusters that are closest to each other

    We will use Euclidean distance to define distance between clusters.

    Recomputing the centroids of all clusters and the distances between all
    pairs of centroids at each step of the loop would be very slow. Thankfully
    most of the distances and centroids remain the same in successive
    iterations of the outer loop; therefore we can speed up the computation by
    only recomputing the centroid and distances for the new merged cluster.

    Even with this trick, this algorithm will consume a lot of memory and run
    very slowly when clustering large set of points. In practice, you probably
    do not want to use this algorithm to cluster more than 10,000 points.
