    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Deriving optical flow equation\n",
    "Optical flow methods are used to estimate motion of objects between two consecutive image frames. For example, in the video above, the can of tea seems to be moving to the left. For our system to be able to understand that the can is moving to the left, it would be useful to find a way to add vectors to the can (known as **flow vectors**) which point to the left, thus describing its motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two consecutive frames, how can we find the flow vectors for the first frame which describe how objects move between frames? To start, we make a reasonable assumption called the **brightness constancy** assumption: the pixel intensity of a moving point stays the same between two consecutive frames with small time difference. In other words, picking any pixel of the moving can, its brightness stays approximately the same between frames--its movement should not affect its brightness after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider pixel intensity (a.k.a. brightness) $I(x, y, t)$ of a point $(x, y)$ in the first frame $t$. Suppose that the point has moved to $(x+\\Delta{x}, y+\\Delta{y})$ after $\\Delta{t}$. According to the brightness constancy assumption, we can relate intensities of the point in the two frames using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I(x,y,t)=I(x+\\Delta{x},y+\\Delta{y},t+\\Delta{t})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to the example of the moving can, this equation simply states that the point that we picked will have the same intensity even after it moves in space $(\\Delta{x}$ and $\\Delta{y})$ and between frames $(\\Delta{t})$. From this simple assumption, we can derive what is known as the **optical flow equation**. For a given point for any frame, the optical flow equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_x({\\mathbf{p}})v_{x} +\n",

    "$v_{x}$ and $v_{y}$ are **flow vectors** in the $x-$ and $y-$direction, respectively. These are the vectors we care about! If we can solve for these two values, we will be able to describe the motion of any object between frames.\n",
