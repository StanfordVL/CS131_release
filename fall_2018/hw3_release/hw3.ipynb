    "## Introduction: Panorama Stitching\n",
    "Panorama stitching is an early success of computer vision. Matthew Brown and David G. Lowe published a famous [panoramic image stitching paper](http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf) in 2007. Since then, automatic panorama stitching technology has been widely adopted in many applications such as Google Street View, panorama photos on smartphones,\n",
    "and stitching software such as Photosynth and AutoStitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will detect and match keypoints from multiple images to build a single panoramic image. This will involve several tasks:\n",
    "1. Use Harris corner detector to find keypoints.\n",
    "2. Build a descriptor to describe each point in an image. <br>\n",
    "   Compare two sets of descriptors coming from two different images and find matching keypoints.\n",
    "3. Given a list of matching keypoints, use least-squares method to find the affine transformation matrix that maps points in one image to another.\n",
    "4. Use RANSAC to give a more robust estimate of affine transformation matrix. <br>\n",
    "   Given the transformation matrix, use it to transform the second image and overlay it on the first image, forming a panorama.\n",
    "5. Implement a different descriptor (HOG descriptor) and get another stitching result."
