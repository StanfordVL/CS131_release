Thus strong edges will (almost) only be due to true edges in the original image. The weak edges can either be due to true edges or noise/color variations.

    "One way of evaluating an edge detector is to compare detected edges with manually specified ground truth edges. Here, we use precision, recall and F1 score as evaluation metrics. We provide you 40 images of objects with ground truth edge annotations. Run the code below to compute precision, recall and F1 score over the entire set of images. Then, tweak the parameters of the Canny edge detector to get as high F1 score as possible. You should be able to achieve F1 score higher than 0.31 by carefully setting the parameters."
