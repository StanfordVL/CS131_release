    "- We recommend basing your code off your `resize_image()` implementation, and applying the same general approach as before. Iterate over each pixel of an output image `(i, j)`, then fill in a color from a corresponding input pixel `(input_i, input_j)`. In this case, note that the output and input images should be the same size.\n",
    "- If you run into an output pixel whose corresponding input coordinates `input_i` and `input_j` that are invalid, you can just ignore that pixel or set it to black.\n",
    "- In our expected output above, we're rotating each coordinate around the center of the image, not the origin. (the origin is located at the top left)"
