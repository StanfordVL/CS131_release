Instead, there are many ways of reasoning about these questions, and we're looking for engagement with and understanding of the purpose and mechanics of HOG, K-Nearest Neighbors, Cross Validation, and splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets. As long as you meaningfully engage with these concepts, as they're relevant to each question, and show understanding of them, you'll earn full credit!\n",

    "We mention a variety of performance metrics for each value of k on the cross validation results: mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. Mean is represented by the middle of each error bar that has the horizontal blue line connecting all the means for each value of k, while standard deviation is the size of the error bar. Mean is the average accuracy of that value of k across all of the cross validation splits, and standard deviation is also measured across the cross validation splits. You only need to consider one of these factors to inform your choice of the 'best' k, but you're free to consider multiple or all of them in your reasoning about choosing the 'best' k. You can get full credit for accurately defending the use of any combination of these metrics.\n",
