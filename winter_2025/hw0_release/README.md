# Homework 0

Open the [`hw0.ipynb` colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DL3e93MJvkS_pbpvTKRxhDDmCoul6fQl?usp=sharing) (ensure you're logged into your Stanford email to access), copy it into your Google Drive, and follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the assignment. Follow the instructions in [this webpage](https://stanford-cs131.github.io/winter2025/assignments.html) to learn how to turn assignments into Gradescope.


<!-- 
If you have not yet cloned (copied this assignment) into your local machine, follow the following steps:

1. In your terminal, navigate to a directory where you want to save your work in progress.
2. Clone the assignments repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/CS131_release.git
```
3. Navigate into the winter_2025 homework directory:
```
cd CS131_release/winter_2025
```
4. Setup a virtual environment that will install all your dependencies.
```
virtualenv -p python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you find that virtualenv is not installed in your local machine, install it by running:
```
sudo pip install virtualenv
```
5. Remember that everytime you take a break and then decide to go back to working on this assignment, you will need to activate your virtualenv to use the dependencies. You can activate your virtualenv by calling the following command under the folder that you created the virtual environment (if you followed the instruction correctly, it should be under CS131_release/winter_2024):
```
source .env/bin/activate
```
Notice that although you should activate the virtual environment under the folder you created the environment, after you activated it, you can navigate to any folders whithin the environment.
6. Now you are ready to start `hw0.ipynb` and start working on your assignment. Start the notebook by calling:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Now go to your web browser (ex, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and go the this url: `localhost:8888`. Click on `hw0.ipynb` to start working on the assignment.
