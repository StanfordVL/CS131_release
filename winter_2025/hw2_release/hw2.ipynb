    "In this section, you are going to implement Harris corner detector for keypoint localization. Review the lecture slides on Harris corner detector to understand how it works. The Harris detection algorithm can be divide into the following steps:\n",
    "1. Compute $x$ and $y$ derivatives ($I_x, I_y$) of an image\n",

    "        I_{x}^2 & I_{x}I_{y} \\\\\n",
    "        I_{x}I_{y} & I_{y}^2\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "4. Compute corner response $R=Det(M)-k(Trace(M)^2)$ at each pixel\n",
    "5. Output corner response map $R(x,y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 is already done for you in the function **`harris_corners`**. We used the [Sobel Operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator), which computes smoothed gradients at each pixel in the x and y direction. See skimage documentation for [sobel_v](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.sobel_v) and [sobel_h](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.sobel_h) for more information on the sobel kernels and operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "For step 3, we've created a uniform window function w for you in the starter code. You can assume that the window size will be odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the function implementation of **`harris_corners`** and run the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint: There are two ways to solve this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorized**: If you want to be really efficient, you can use the function `scipy.ndimage.convolve`, and compute the response map R at every pixel all at once. If you're clever with your convolutions and determinant and trace calculations, you can compute the windowed gradients in $M$ ($\\sum_{x,y} w(x,y) \\cdot I_x^2$, and $\\sum_{x,y} w(x,y) \\cdot I_y^2$, and $\\sum_{x,y} w(x,y) \\cdot I_{xy}$), and then compute the response map without any for loops! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative**: The more intuitive solution is to iterate through each pixel of the image, compute $M$ based on the surrounding neighborhood of pixel gradients in $I_x$, $I_y$, and $I_{xy}$, and then compute the response map pixel $R(x,y)$. You may find your implementations of conv_nested and conv_fast from HW 1 to be useful references! \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you'll want to explictly specify zero-padding to match the Harris response map definition, but we'll accept the default behavior of `scipy.ndimage.convolve` as well. If you use zero-padding, both the vectorized and for-loop implementations will get you to the same answer! \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'Alternate Accepted Harris Corner Solution' image presents the result of `scipy.ndimage.convolve`'s default reflection padding, while the 'Harris Corner Solution' image presents the zero-padding solution. Similarly, 'Alternate Accepted Detected Corners Solution' image presents the result of `scipy.ndimage.convolve`'s default reflection padding, while the 'Detected Corners Solution' image presents the zero-padding solution. **Both are accepted solutions!**\n"

    "Next, implement the **`match_descriptors`** function to find good matches in two sets of descriptors. First, calculate Euclidean distance between all pairs of descriptors from image 1 and image 2. Then use this to determine if there is a good match: for each descriptor in image 1, if the distance to the closest descriptor in image 2 is significantly (by a given factor) smaller than the distance to the second-closest, we call it a match. The output of the function is an array where each row holds the indices of one pair of matching descriptors.\n",
