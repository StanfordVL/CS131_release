# Project 2 Guidelines 

CS131, Winter 2024

This project asks you to choose a concept from the selection below and expand on it creatively. You should choose a topic that seems most interesting to you. (This is a great starting point as exploration for a final project as well!) 

Please see [Project 2 Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_yLzSePaVH2OrQgzZsu-1sZ4ez1Da9_tFzZFM3LCarQ) for the most updated project guidelines. 


## Part 1 (50%): 

Read through the notebooks to get a sense of which one might interest you the most. Select **one** of the following topics to complete the notebook:

- Option A: Filter and Object Detection (Lecture 7)

- Option B: Edge Detection and Hough Transform (Lecture 8-9) 

- Option C: Optical Flow and Object Tracking (Lecture 13)

- Option D: K-means Clustering and Image Segmentation (Lectures 10-12)


## Part 2 (50%): 

The next part will be your project exploration and implementation, expanding on the concepts from a notebook of choice. 

While this section is open-ended in the topic that you choose to explore, we ask that you complete the following: 

- Review of current methods (5%) 

  - Once you’ve selected a topic or project idea, explore the literature space. Has there been academic research on this topic? Are there tutorials online, software packages, or libraries? 

  - Select **at least** 5 resources (youtube videos, papers, tutorials, opensource software, libraries, etc) and provide a short description (2-3 sentences) 

- Code (35%) 

  - We expect you to write code for this project (CS131 is, after all, a CS class 🙂). You may implement algorithms from scratch or expand on algorithms from this notebook if you would like, but using other libraries or other open-source software in a creative way is also sufficient. (ie. combining methods from different libraries). Here are some suggestions for starting points: 

    - Option A - 

      - Advanced filter methods- build on the filters from this notebook to  emulate filters from social media or photo-editing apps!

      - Advanced image recognition techniques (i.e. extend object detection problem to be more general, handle more objects, etc)

    - Option B - 

      - Edge/lane detection using your own images - analy

      - Enhancing the edge detection algorithm

    - Option C- 

      - Optimizing object tracker

      - Analyzing interesting failure cases/success cases around object detection

    - Option D- 

      - Object detection after k-means clustering

      - Implementing advanced feature extractors

  - Consult a TA if you’re unsure or confused on what to do!

- Writeup (10%) 

  - An explanation of what you did, and how it relates to the topic of choice. Please attach any images, figures, etc. (\~200 words) 


## Submission Instructions: 

_\[Will be updated once autograder is released]_

Please find the relevant gradescope assignment to the one that you did and submit that one only. You should submit 2 total gradescope assignments: 

- Option \[X] Notebook Code 

- Option \[X] Written Component
